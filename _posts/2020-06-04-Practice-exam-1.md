This practice exam is not comprehensive.
I could include any exercise or example from any of the notes.

In particular, I think the real exam may include questions such as "What is the domain of this function?
How many connected regions does this domain break into?
If a solution x(t) satisfies the initial condition x(a) = b, which region does it lie in?"
Etc.  

On the subject of domains and regions, see my [solution to HW 02, Exercise 3](https://hopmath.github.io/2020/06/02/02-solutions), which corrects a mistake I made -- and nobody pointed out! -- regarding the domain of a function f(x,y) in two dimensions.  
For instance, what is the domain of f(x, y) = sqrt(x)? It's the entire right half-plane.
