### Material

- Ordinary Differential Equations
- Heavy emphasis on graphing and numerical solutions with Python
- Matrix techniques for linear systems and linearizations
- Laplace transforms
- Power series methods
- **This course is approved for satisfying the "Computer Applications" requirement in the Math Major.
It is therefore expected that students receive substation exposure to computing.**
